ncurses interacts eavily with the terminal, as you might expect.
terminals the world over buffer any characters that are beng pressed into a line buffer adn none of it at all is written out to screen unless a return is pressed.

this is often a nuisance. the way around it with ncurses is the "raw()" call.

getch();
--------
now this requests _any_ character from the user: essentially, a keypress.
Often uses to hold onto current screen until next key is pressed.

clear();
--------
this will clear the screen. This is actually more or less essential unless you want some remanants of the previous screen staying on.

refresh():
----------
not sure of the utility of this. In the beginning I tought it might clear screen, but obviously, cler() does that.
OK, I think I know. It's to be used in connection with any "painting" because what you do is "Paint the buffer"
and you need to update the screen, which is what refresh() is
